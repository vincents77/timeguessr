You are tasked with generating structured metadata for a historical event: "{idea}".

Respond in pure JSON format, without any commentary.

Required fields:
- title
- year (integer)
- coords (array [latitude, longitude])
- theme (pick from: wars & battles, foundational political moments, diplomacy & international relations, law & justice, social movements & protests, scientific & technological breakthroughs, natural disasters, architecture & engineering, exploration & discovery, art & culture, royalty & coronations, religious history, economic & industrial history, migration & demographic change)
- region (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Oceania)
- notable_figures (comma-separated)
- visuals (array of 3‚Äì5 short visual elements)
- prompt (full DALL¬∑E prompt description)
- country
- city (if any)
- notable_location (if any)
- caption (1‚Äì2 sentence clue or contextual enrichment that hints at or deepens the event, for display after the game round)
- wiki_url (URL to the best matching Wikipedia article)

Special instructions:
- When generating the `prompt` field for the image, always follow this structure:
"A highly detailed, photo-realistic image of [title] as it might have appeared at the time. 
The scene includes [visual elements], depicted with authentic clothing, environment, and technology from the historical era. 
Captured as if by a high-resolution camera. No text or modern artifacts. Realistic proportions, cinematic style."
- Prioritize scenes that include recognizable city features, landscapes, important buildings, or architecture when relevant to the event.
- Human activity (e.g., battles, ceremonies, education) should still be central, but framed within authentic settings when possible.
- If the event takes place indoors, consider showing elements of the architecture or view of the surrounding location if appropriate.
- Ensure that clothing, crowns, tools, furniture, artifacts, and architecture match the specific time period (avoid anachronisms).
Respond only with valid JSON. No text around it.
